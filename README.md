## ðŸ§  Overview

The project aims to detect dyslexia in children by analyzing their handwritten images using a lightweight deep learning pipeline. It employs image preprocessing, feature extraction using YOLOv7, and classification using a MobileNetV2 + SSD-Lite model.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

- `pre_processing.ipynb`  
  Applies image enhancement using CLAHE, resizing (512Ã—512), normalization, and data augmentation.

- `training.ipynb`  
  Loads extracted features, builds and trains the classification model (MobileNetV2 + SSD Lite), evaluates performance metrics like accuracy, F1-score, mAP, and mIoU.

- `features.pkl`  
  Pickled feature vectors extracted using the YOLOv7 model, used for classification training.

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- PyYAML (for YOLOv7 configuration if needed)

Install using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## ðŸ“Š Dataset
We use the publicly available Dyslexia Handwriting Dataset from Kaggle (2019) and augment it with additional handwritten samples.

Classes:

Normal

Reversal (Dyslexia)

## ðŸª¶ Model Architecture
YOLOv7 â€“ Feature extraction

MobileNetV2 + SSD-Lite â€“ Classification (normal vs dyslexic handwriting)

Adam Optimizer â€“ Hyperparameter tuning
